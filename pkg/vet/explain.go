const unaThr001Explain = `UNA-THR-001: unsynchronized read-modify-write

A read-modify-write reads a value, changes it, and stores the result back, which
is three steps. Under CPython's GIL those steps could not interleave with another
thread, so ` + "`counter += 1`" + ` behaved as if it were atomic. Without the GIL,
and on unagi, two threads can read the same value, each add one, and each store,
so one update is lost.

    counter = 0

    def worker():
        global counter
        for _ in range(100_000):
            counter += 1          # racy: read, add, store

The value stays a well-formed int and nothing crashes, but the final total is
smaller than it should be. Guard the update with a lock so the three steps run as
one:

    lock = threading.Lock()

    def worker():
        global counter
        for _ in range(100_000):
            with lock:
                counter += 1

The faster fix needs no lock at all: give each worker a private counter and
combine the results after join, so the threads never share a mutable cell.

    def worker(out, i):
        total = 0
        for _ in range(100_000):
            total += 1
        out[i] = total            # one writer per slot, summed after join
`

const unaThr002Explain = `UNA-THR-002: check-then-act race

A check-then-act tests a shared object and then, in a separate step, acts on
that observation. Under the GIL the two steps could not interleave, so the
observation was still true when the action ran. Without the GIL another thread
can change the object in the gap, so both threads pass the check and both act.

    cache = {}

    def get(key):
        if key not in cache:      # check
            cache[key] = build(key)   # act on a now-stale observation
        return cache[key]

Two threads can both find key missing, both call build, and the second store
overwrites the first, so the work is done twice and one result is discarded. The
lazy-init shape has the same window:

    if conn is None:
        conn = connect()          # two threads open two connections

Hold a lock across both halves so the check and the act are one step:

    with lock:
        if key not in cache:
            cache[key] = build(key)

Where the primitive offers it, an atomic operation closes the window without a
lock: dict.setdefault performs the test and the insert in one call.

    cache.setdefault(key, build(key))
`
